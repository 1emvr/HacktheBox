### Current key is applicable only to example.com. You are trying to use the following key: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX[](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/typical-errors/#current-key)

Your license key is tied to a specific domain (e.g., `example.com`) and will not work on any other domain.

Make sure your license key is used on the domain it was issued for (e.g., `example.com`). If you need a license key for another domain, [contact our team](https://www.flexmonster.com/contact/).

It looks like they tried to copy/paste a key for something called `flexmonster` and forgot to remove it, or it's simply a trial key.
